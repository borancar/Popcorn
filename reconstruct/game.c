 * more set bits so that `al = 0x55 & ah` fills in one more pixel of the four
 * in a byte. Each phase draws two 49-pixel vertical runs, one in each half of
 * the interlace, spaced 0x50 bytes apart so they step a row at a time.
 *
 * The second grows the title lettering into the top right corner, a row at a
 * time from one to 0x69, reading backwards from 0x8318 so the picture grows
 * upwards from its own bottom edge.
 *
 * Between the two sits a colour remap that is easy to misread. It walks the
 * copy in the work buffer taking two source bits at a time and emitting two:
 * a leading 0 emits `00` and **discards the bit after it**, a leading 1 emits
 * `1` followed by that bit. So pixel value 1 becomes 0 and 2 and 3 are kept -
 * it strips the cyan out of the leading edge, which is what makes the
 * lettering fade in rather than snap on. Only the first 0xbd bytes get it,
 * seven rows, which is exactly the leading edge.
